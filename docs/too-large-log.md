    content: 'This document describes the Tool Invocation component in Onyx, which displays AI tool call executions and results in a mobile-friendly format. Located in `app/onyx/markdown/ToolInvocation.tsx` and integrated into `app/onyx/markdown/MessageContent.tsx`, it shows tool status, parameters, and results interactively.  Features include displaying status (pending/completed/failed), tool/repository information, and modals for input parameters and file content.  It details component structure (props, visual elements), usage in MessageContent, styling (using React Native StyleSheet), modal system (for parameters and file content), status indicators, and integration with the message system. Best practices emphasize providing complete data, handling all states, and testing interactions. Error handling covers invalid data, JSON parsing, and content issues. Future improvements include animations, expanded interactions, tool-specific displays, and enhanced error messaging.\n'
